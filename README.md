# NoGuidesOrTutorials
A repository where I aim to implement existing games/ projects through blood sweat and many tears, using no guides or tutorials but a basic understanding.

# Pong
A remake of the classic game 70's Atari game. It is made with two players in mind with the use of the W and S and Up and Down keys. I wanted to practice writing some Kotlin and JavaFx and combined them both. I noticed there was a lot of duplication here and there and the code could be massively cleaned up and made more Kotlin-y. This is hopefully the first of many classic remakes, using no guides or tutorials. Enjoy! Side Note: Getting the correct deflection was a pain and took many attempts, I am still not sure it is entirely accurate :/

With special thanks to https://github.com/games50/pong/blob/master/pong-9/font.ttf for the Pong font.
